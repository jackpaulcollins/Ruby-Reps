Given an array of integers ```nums``` and an integer ``target``, find two distinct indices in the array such that nums[i] + nums[j] = target. You may assume that there is exactly one solution, and you cannot use the same element twice.

Return an array containing i and j. You can return the answer in any order.

Example:

```
Input:

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9

Output:

[0, 1]
```

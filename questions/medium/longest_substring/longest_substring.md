Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string. For example, in the string "abcabcbb," the longest substring without repeating characters is "abc," which has a length of 3. Another example is "bbbbb," where the longest substring without repeating characters is "b," with a length of 1.

```
input:

s = "abcabcbb"

output: 3
```
